# LibertyMail - minimalist, sleek email client for those who value automation

## From the Founders of Eye of Liberty - https://eyeofliberty.com

Welcome everyone, the project is currently under construction. If you have any questions, email us at eye [at] eyeofliberty.com

## Development TODO
- In the file explorer, allow selecting the file by double click (could work on some devices right now, but not all)
- Make the UI a bit more responsive
- Either bundle the program with a font, or add support for non-Windows fonts
- Make columns disappear if the user wants to
- Allow the user to delete entries by right clicking in the contact view page (currently have to do it manually in the csv file)
